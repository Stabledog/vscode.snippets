# Snippets in VSCode

- The [Snippet Creator plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wware.snippet-creator) permits creating snippets from selected text, but the back end does not work in WSL.  You can switch the back-end to Windows and use it still.

- The `AppData/Roaming/User/Code/snippets` folder gets shared and merged between machine branches just like any VSCode user settings

- The `test/` folder has various test files to trigger language detection for testing
